# GottiWeather

The project is mainly focused on confirming my skills as a developer, using several techniques in C# as dependency injection, generics, globalization, MVC, rest services, among others.  

I integrated AccuWeather API with .net Core, and created a simple responsive app to show a 5-day forecast. AccuWeather API has 50 call limit by day. Set your own API key on appsetings.json, itÂ´s free.
